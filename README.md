Una is a Lightning network node wrapper for all the existing Lightning backends: LND, c-lightning, Eclair, LndHub, LNBits, and more.

Una allows you to build a backend-agnostic Lightning application: starting from now, you no longer need to implement support for each Lightning node, it is supported right away!

Una is a Rust library, offering bindings to Python and NodeJS. It is thus available as a [crate](https://crates.io/crates/una), a [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/) and an [NPM package](https://npmjs.com/). Learn more how it works [here](bindings/README.md).

ðŸš§ Una is still in development: methods and backends are missing. An HTTP and gRPC API is also in development.
